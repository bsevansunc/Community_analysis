METHODS

Observation data were collected as a part of the Neighborhood Nestwatch Program, a citizen science project run out of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. Nestwatch has established a network of sampling sites within the Greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area with sampling predominantly located in the backyards of project participants. Sites in this study range from rural open and forested areas, to suburban and urban environments. In order to more accurately characterize the rural-to-urban gradient supplemental survey data were collected from 30 sites from forested and core urban (> 50% impervious surface) habitats, portions of the gradient that were somewhat under-represented within Nestwatch. Combined, these sites are representative of the rural-to-urban gradient within our study region (see Evans et al. 2015, Appendix A).

Between the years of 2009 and 2012, technicians visited sites once annually (May-August) and conducted a ten minute, fixed radius point count (50 m). The distances between the observer and individual birds were estimated in 10m distance segments (e.g., 0-10m). Flyovers were not recorded as they may not be representative of birds with established territories within the point count radius. Likewise, count data were subset to include only species with known breeding ranges within our study region.
We evaluated observed species dietary, foraging, and nesting niches, as well as each species’ range size and the variation in habitats in which a species has been observed.  Dietary and foraging niche data were obtained from an avian trait database of compiled by Wilman et al. (2014). Nest data, including nest substrate and nest height were obtained from Birds of North America (Poole et al. 2014). For each of these life history traits, which are a component of a species’ Eltonian niche, we calculated the degree of variation in the trait, and standardized these to a value between zero and one, with zero representing a niche specialist and one representing a generalist. Evaluated components of a species Grinnelian niche breadth included the range size of a species and the diversity in habitats in which a species occurs. These data were obtained from a previous study (Hurlbert and White 2007) on species occurrence across Breeding Bird survey sampling routes.

We used the proportion of impervious surface as a proxy variable to characterize the degree of urbanization of each site. This proxy variable has been found to be most predictive of avian demographic response to urbanization (see Ryder et al. 2010) and has been found to adequately reflect the variation in habitat distribution and quality across the rural-to-urban gradient (reviewed in McKinney 2002). Across our samples, impervious surface was highly predictive of core urban and suburban land cover types with sites at the rural end of the urbanization gradient predominantly comprised of agricultural or forested habitats (see Evans et. al 2015, Appendix A). We used the raster package in R (Hijmans 2014) to calculate the proportion of impervious surface (30 m resolution, Fry et al. 2011) within a 100 m neighborhood of each sampling location. This scale was chosen because it is incorporates the breeding territory size of birds that intersect the 50m point count radius. Because avian response to urbanization is likely nonlinear, we included both linear (IMP) and quadratic (IMP2) impervious terms as predictor variables for all analyses (see Evans et al. 2015). 

We calculated estimates of the species richness at each site and evaluated the relationship between richness values and the proportion of impervious surface surrounding each site. Site-level species richness was estimated in the R Package SPECIES (Wang 2014) using the penalized conditional nonparametric maximum likelihood method of Wang and Lindsay (2005). This method has been found to provide accurate richness estimates (Wang 2011). We used a generalized linear model framework to evaluate the variation in the total richness of a given site across the rural-to-urban gradient as well as the proportional richness of feeding and nesting guilds and native and nonnative species. 

To estimate abundance, we adjusted count data for detectability using the R Package unmarked (Fiske and Chandler 2015). We used the generalized distance sampling model of Chandler (2011) to fit yearly and site covariates to adjust abundance estimates by detectability. As birds in open habitats are more readily observed, we calculated the proportional canopy cover within 50m of the point count location and used this value as a continuous covariate for detection (Fry et al. 2011). Because bird activity varies considerably at different times of day and at different stages in the breeding cycle, we included the Julian day of the point count and the time of day as annual covariates for detectability. Likewise, as bird activity may vary under weather conditions, temperature was used as an annual detectability covariate. Finally, because point counts were conducted by multiple technicians of varying skill levels, the observer was used as a group covariate for detection (Ralph et al. 1995).

To assess community-level variation in niche breadth, we adapted the Index of waterbird community integrity developed by Deluca et al. (2004, 2008). For each species, we summed components of a species Eltonian and Grinnelian niche breadths and standardized these values to between zero and one. We assessed community-level Eltonian and Grinnelian niche breadths separately and combined, standardizing the combined value to between zero and one. We summed the standardized niche breadths by the estimated abundances of each species at a given site and divided this value by the total abundance at this site. We then evaluated the abundance-scaled community niche breadths across the rural-to-urban gradient using a generalized linear model approach with impervious surface and a quadratic term for impervious surface as our predictor variables. 

We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to assess the composition of communities, in species and life history guild space, across the rural-to-urban gradient using the R Package Vegan (Oksanen et al. 2014). To assess the influence of urbanization on community composition, we evaluated the portion of the variance explained by impervious surface across sites (see Legendre and Legendre 2012). To test the influence of impervious surface on community composition we a permutation-based analysis of variance of species or niche and impervious surface dissimilarity matrices  (Anderson 2001).
